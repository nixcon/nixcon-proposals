# NixCon proposals

Here we gather proposals for NixCon.
Feel free to open a issue if you were missing something last time or have some suggestions for improvements.
There is also issue templates for venue proposals to give you a bit of a guide what we need to know.

You can also go to the [#nixcon](https://matrix.to/#/#nixcon:matrix.org) matrix room to ask questions and talk with other participants.
Or reach out to us directly by [mail](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/lets-make-nixcon-2024-together/35973#emails-to-reach-out-to-the-pl-team-5).
